      "text": "In the early eighties of last century -- Court, near Waterford, was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. S-- and their family of two young boys and a girl of twenty-one years of age. Below the house is a marshy glen with a big open drain cut through it. Late one evening the daughter was out shooting rabbits near this drain and saw, as she thought, her half-brother standing by the drain in a sailor suit, which like other small boys he wore. She called to him once or twice, end to her surprise got no reply. She went towards him, and when she got close he suddenly disappeared. The next day she asked an old dependent, who had lived many years in the place, if there was anything\ncurious about the glen. He replied at once: \"Oh! you mean the little sailor man. Sure, he won't do you any harm.\" This was the first she had heard of anything of the sort, but it was then found that none of the country-people would go through the glen after dusk.\nSome time afterwards two sons of the clergyman of the parish in which -- Court stands were out one evening fishing in the drain, when one of them suddenly said, \"What's that sailor doing there?\" The other saw nothing, and presently the figure vanished. At the time of the appearance neither had heard of Miss S--'s experience, and no one has been able to explain it, as there is apparently no tradition of any \"little sailor man\" having been there in the flesh."
