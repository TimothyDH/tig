Some day, no doubt, psychologists and scientists will be able to give us a complete and satisfactory explanation of these abnormal apparitions, but at present we are very much in the dark, and any explanation that may be put forward is necessarily of a tentative nature.The following story is sent us by Mr. J. J. Crowley, of the Munster and Leinster Bank, who writes as follows: \"The scene is outside Clonmel, on the main road leading up to a nice old residence on the side of the mountains called -- Lodge. I happened to be visiting my friends, two other bank men.

They told the story to their landlady, and learned from her that this apparition had frequently been seen about the place, and was the spirit of one of her daughters who had died years previously rather young, and who, previous to her death, had gone about just as we described the figure we had seen.
